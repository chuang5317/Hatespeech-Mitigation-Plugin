<p>We wrote a book on Mathematics for Machine Learning that motivates 
people to learn mathematical concepts. The book is not intended to cover
 advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty 
of books doing this. Instead, we aim to provide the necessary 
mathematical skills to read those other books.</p>

<p>The book will be <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/academic/subjects/computer-science/pattern-recognition-and-machine-learning/mathematics-machine-learning?format=PB">published by Cambridge University Press</a> in early 2020.</p>

<p>We split the book into two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mathematical foundations</li>
  <li>Example machine learning algorithms that use the mathematical foundations</li>
</ul>

<p>We aim to keep this book fairly short, so we don’t cover everything.</p>

<p><strong>We will keep PDFs of this book freely available after publication.</strong></p>

<h3 id="pdf-of-the-book"><a href="https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf">PDF of the book</a></h3>
<p>This version is the most up-to-date version of the book, i.e., we continue fixing typos etc.</p>

<p>This version is equivalent (modulo formatting) with the printed 
version of the book. GitHub issues starting from 433 are not included in
 this version.</p>

  <li><a href="https://mml-book.github.io/tutorials/tutorial_pca.ipynb">PCA</a></li>
  <li>SVM (work in progress)</li>
</ol>

<p>‘This book provides great coverage of all the basic mathematical 
concepts for machine learning. I’m looking forward to sharing it with 
students, colleagues, and anyone interested in building a solid 
understanding of the fundamentals.’
Joelle Pineau</p>

<p>‘The field of machine learning has grown dramatically in recent 
years, with an increasingly impressive spectrum of successful 
applications. This comprehensive text covers the key mathematical 
concepts that underpin modern machine learning, with a focus on linear 
algebra, calculus, and probability theory. It will prove valuable both 
as a tutorial for newcomers to the field, and as a reference text for 
machine learning researchers and engineers.’
Christopher Bishop</p>

<p>‘The book hits the right level of detail for me. Too many of the ML 
books have a “don’t worry your pretty head about this detail” mentality,
   or go the other way and overwhelm me with detail. Your book is 
comprehensive and has a sense of ease and expanse, but it feels like I 
can get to the application part quickly enough.’
Sriram Srinivasan</p>
